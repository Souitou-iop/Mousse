        // constructor, every frame can end up as a whole wheel line — terminals in mouse-reporting
        // mode (vim/tmux/TUIs) then receive 60–120 wheel reports per second, flooding the program
        // until raw `ESC[<65;…M` sequences spill onto the screen as garbage text.

        // WRITE ORDER MATTERS: the line-delta setter re-syncs the fixed-point and point deltas to
        // the whole-line value (they are three views of one axis), so the precise pixel writes
        // must come AFTER it — line first, then fixed-point, then point. Writing the line delta
        // last quantizes every frame to whole lines: slow glides then move in 0/±1 px lumps
        // (visible shaking) and everything scrolls ~10× slower than planned.
        // Field semantics copied from real trackpad events (and Mac Mouse Fix's long-proven
        // synthesis): the line delta AND the fixed-point delta are both in LINE units —
        // fixed-point is the precise fractional line count, the integer field is its
        // accumulated whole part. Only the POINT delta is in pixels; that's what
        // `scrollingDeltaY` (GUI smoothness) reads on continuous events. Terminals build their
        // mouse reports from `deltaY` — the fixed-point field — so putting PIXELS there makes
        // a 47 px frame read as 47 LINES and floods vim/tmux with reports (`ESC[<65;…M`
        // garbage). `lineUnit` is the glide's own px-per-device-line ratio (acceleration means
        // one notch can glide 30–100 px): dividing by it makes the emitted line count equal
        // the device's, so terminals jump the same few lines the wheel actually turned.
