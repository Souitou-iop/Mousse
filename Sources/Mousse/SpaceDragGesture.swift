/// Hold a mouse button and drag to drive Spaces/Mission Control like the trackpad gesture:
///   • horizontal drag → switch Spaces (one jump per `threshold` px, paced by a cooldown)
///   • vertical drag   → up = Mission Control, down = App Exposé
/// The active axis is locked at the start of each drag so a swipe never does both.
///
/// Click-vs-drag: the same button can ALSO carry a normal remap. A quick click (no real drag) is
/// reported back to the engine so it fires the button's mapped action; a click-and-drag does the
/// gesture instead. So one button can be e.g. Mission Control on click, switch Spaces on drag.
///
/// Horizontal drags drive the REAL WindowServer Space-slide via synthesized dock-swipe events
/// (`DockSwipeSynthesizer`), so the transition follows the pointer like a three-finger trackpad
/// swipe. Discrete Symbolic-HotKey jumps (`SystemActions`) remain the fallback — when the user
/// turns follow-finger off, or on macOS 27+ where field-based dock-swipe synthesis no longer works
/// (WindowServer reads an attached IOHIDEvent instead; not ported yet). Vertical drags stay
/// discrete (Mission Control / App Exposé are toggles, not slides). In discrete mode a fast flick
/// on release fires one extra jump for momentum feel; follow-finger gets that natively via the
/// swipe's exit speed.
///
/// State here is touched only on the event-tap thread; the public knobs are set from the same
/// thread at the top of each callback, so no locking is needed.
